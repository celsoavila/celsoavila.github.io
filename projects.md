# Projects

Below are public projects illustrating my work in financial data engineering,
quant research and ML applied to markets.

## Factor Fund – Factor-based & ML-driven Equity Strategy

**Repository:** https://github.com/celsoavila/factor-fund

A public, anonymized research pipeline demonstrating:

- **M1 – Data Preparation**  
  Synthetic factor matrix for equities (Value, Momentum, Quality, Size, Volatility).

- **M2 – Prediction Model**  
  Cross-sectional Ridge model for forward returns.

- **M3 – Portfolio Construction**  
  Long-only demo portfolio based on model scores.

- **M4 – Backtesting & Performance**  
  Synthetic backtest vs. equal-weight benchmark, including metrics and equity curves.

- **M5 – Factor Analysis**  
  Ridge coefficients as factor importance and correlations with future returns.

The repository is designed as a **professional showcase** of architecture, code quality,
and quantitative workflow.

## Additional work (non-public)

I have also designed and built:

- Research/production pipelines for systematic equity funds  
- Data and ML infrastructure for credit receivables & payments  
- Real-time and daily portfolio engines  
- Tokenization & DLT architectures for receivables and funds  

Details of production systems can be discussed in conversations.
